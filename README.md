These dotfiles are not free or open-source, despite being hosted on a public
Github. Because they are not open-source, you may not reproduce them in any
unapproved format. I have not approved *any* formats, but browser caches and the
human short- and long-term memory systems are *particularly* unapproved. If you
have accessed this page in error or not in error, please wipe your browser's
cache before attempting to wipe your short- and long-term memories, which you
must do (try a hammer) in order to avoid retaining any copy ("memory") of any
part of this repo.

It is your legal responsibility to comply with this nonsense.
