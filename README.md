This are my dotfiles, ~/bin scripts, etc.

## LICENSE

These dotfiles are neither free nor open-source, despite being hosted on a public Github. Because they are not open-source, you may not reproduce them in any unapproved format. I have not approved *any* formats, but browser caches, computer memory, and the human short- and long-term memory systems are *particularly* unapproved. If you have accessed this page in error or not in error, please wipe your browser's cache and microwave your computer's memory and hard drive(s) on high for fifty (50) minutes before attempting to wipe your short- and long-term memories, which you must do (try a hammer) in order to avoid retaining any copy ("memory") of any part of this repo, including (but not limited to) the contents of this README.

It is your legal responsibility to comply with this nonsense.
